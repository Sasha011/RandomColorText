# RandomColorText

# User story
I’d like to color a paragraph of text into random colors (not ordered in a particular way). List of colors needs to be entered by the user with appropriate input validation and stored in array. Two neighboring letters should not have the same color.

# Notes:
Input can be multi line and may use both comma and semicolon as delimiters.
Input example: Red, Orange; Yellow, Green, Blue

# Input validation:
•             Input string is not empty
•             Input string does not contain invalid characters
•             All colors names are valid

# Implementation details:
•             Pure client-side implementation using JavaScript or TypeScript
•             Implementation should be as optimal as possible

# Other:
•             You can use the text from the user story as your input paragraph.
